## Getting Started
This page describes how to deploy remote shuffle service on Kubernetes. You can use the released image directly: docker.io/flinkshuffle/flink-remote-shuffle:VERSION. Note that you need to replace the 'VERSION' filed with the actual version you want to use, for example, 0.3.0.

### Introduction
Kubernetes is a popular container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. Remote shuffle service allows you to directly deploy the services on a running Kubernetes cluster.

### Preparation
The `Getting Started` section assumes that your environment fulfills the following requirements:
- A functional Kubernetes cluster (Kubernetes >= 1.13).

- Make sure a valid Zookeeper cluster is ready. Or you can refer to [setting up a Zookeeper cluster](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperStarted.html) to start a Zookeeper cluster manually.

- [Download the latest binary release](https://github.com/flink-extended/flink-remote-shuffle/releases) or [build remote shuffle service yourself](https://github.com/flink-extended/flink-remote-shuffle#building-from-source).

If you have problems setting up a Kubernetes cluster, take a look at [how to setup a Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/).

## Deploying Remote Shuffle Service Cluster
The remote shuffle service cluster contains a `ShuffleManager` and multiple `ShuffleWorker`s. The `ShuffleManager` runs as a Kubernetes [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) (the number of replicas is 1), and the shuffle workers run as a Kubernetes [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) which means the number of `ShuffleWorker`s is the same as the number of machines in the Kubernetes cluster. The following two points should be noted here:

1. Currently, we only support host network for network communication.

2. The shuffle workers use a [hostPath](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath) volume (specified by `remote-shuffle.kubernetes.worker.volume.host-paths`) or a [emptydir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) volume (specified by `remote-shuffle.kubernetes.worker.volume.empty-dirs`) for shuffle data storage.

Additionally, to make it easier to deploy on a Kubernetes cluster, we provided a Kubernetes [Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) for remote shuffle service, which can control the life cycle of remote shuffle service instances, including creation, deletion, and upgrade.

### Deploying Remote Shuffle Operator
Once you have your Kubernetes cluster ready and `kubectl` is configured to point to it, you can launch an operator via:

```sh
# Note: You must configure the docker image to be used by modifying the template file first before running this command.

kubectl apply -f kubernetes-shuffle-operator-template.yaml
```

The template file `kubernetes-shuffle-operator-template.yaml` should be in `conf/` directory and its contents are as follows.

```yaml

```

### Deploying Remote Shuffle Cluster
Then you can start `ShuffleManager` and `ShuffleWorker`s via:

```sh
# Note: You must accomplish the template file first before running this command.

kubectl apply -f kubernetes-shuffle-cluster-template.yaml
```

The template file `kubernetes-shuffle-cluster-template.yaml` should be in `conf/` directory and its contents are as follows.

```yaml
apiVersion: shuffleoperator.alibaba.com/v1
kind: RemoteShuffle
metadata:
  namespace: flink-system-rss
  name: flink-remote-shuffle
spec:
  shuffleDynamicConfigs:
    remote-shuffle.manager.jvm-opts: -verbose:gc -Xloggc:/flink-remote-shuffle/log/gc.log
    remote-shuffle.worker.jvm-opts: -verbose:gc -Xloggc:/flink-remote-shuffle/log/gc.log
    remote-shuffle.kubernetes.manager.cpu: 4
    remote-shuffle.kubernetes.worker.cpu: 4
    remote-shuffle.kubernetes.worker.limit-factor.cpu: 8
    remote-shuffle.kubernetes.container.image: <docker image>
    remote-shuffle.kubernetes.worker.volume.host-paths: name:disk,path:<dir on host>,mountPath:/data
    remote-shuffle.storage.local-data-dirs: '[SSD]/data'
    remote-shuffle.high-availability.mode: ZOOKEEPER
    remote-shuffle.ha.zookeeper.quorum: <zookeeper quorum>
    remote-shuffle.kubernetes.manager.env-vars: <env-vars> # You need to configure your time zone here, for example, TZ:Asia/Shanghai.
    remote-shuffle.kubernetes.worker.env-vars:  <env-vars> # You need to configure your time zone here, for example, TZ:Asia/Shanghai.

  shuffleFileConfigs:
    log4j2.properties: |
      monitorInterval=30

      rootLogger.level = INFO
      rootLogger.appenderRef.console.ref = ConsoleAppender
      rootLogger.appenderRef.rolling.ref = RollingFileAppender

      # Log all info to the console
      appender.console.name = ConsoleAppender
      appender.console.type = CONSOLE
      appender.console.layout.type = PatternLayout
      appender.console.layout.pattern = %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,SSS} %-5p [%t] %-60c %x - %m%n

      # Log all info in the given rolling file
      appender.rolling.name = RollingFileAppender
      appender.rolling.type = RollingFile
      appender.rolling.append = true
      appender.rolling.fileName = ${sys:log.file}
      appender.rolling.filePattern = ${sys:log.file}.%i
      appender.rolling.layout.type = PatternLayout
      appender.rolling.layout.pattern = %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,SSS} %-5p [%t] %-60c %x - %m%n
      appender.rolling.policies.type = Policies
      appender.rolling.policies.size.type = SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy
      appender.rolling.policies.size.size=256MB
      appender.rolling.policies.startup.type = OnStartupTriggeringPolicy
      appender.rolling.strategy.type = DefaultRolloverStrategy
      appender.rolling.strategy.max = ${env:MAX_LOG_FILE_NUMBER:-10}
```

- Note that `remote-shuffle.ha.zookeeper.quorum` should be accomplished according to the actual environment.

- Note that `remote-shuffle.kubernetes.container.image` should be accomplished according to the shuffle service image built from source code.

- Note that `remote-shuffle.kubernetes.worker.volume.host-paths` should be accomplished according to the actual storage path on host to be used.

- Note that `remote-shuffle.kubernetes.manager.env-vars` and `remote-shuffle.kubernetes.worker.env-vars` should be accomplished to specify the right time zone.

If you want to build a new image by yourself, please refer to [preparing docker environment](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [building from source](https://github.com/flink-extended/flink-remote-shuffle#building-from-source).

After successfully running the above command `kubectl apply -f XXX`, a new shuffle service cluster will be started.

## Submitting a Flink Job

To submit a Flink job, please refer to [starting a Flink cluster](https://github.com/flink-extended/flink-remote-shuffle/blob/master/docs/quick_start.md#starting-a-flink-cluster) and [submitting a Flink job](https://github.com/flink-extended/flink-remote-shuffle/blob/master/docs/quick_start.md#submitting-a-flink-job).

If you would like to run Flink jobs on Kubernetes, you need to follow the below steps:

1. First of all, you need to build a new Flink docker image which contains remote shuffle plugin JAR file. Please refer to [how to customize the Flink Docker image](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.14/docs/deployment/resource-providers/standalone/docker/#advanced-customization) for more information. The following is a simple customized Flink Docker file example:

```dockerfile
FROM flink

# The path of shuffle plugin JAR should be the lib/ directory of the remote shuffle distribution which need to be replaced by the really path in your environment.
COPY /<Path of the shuffle plugin JAR>/shuffle-plugin-<version>.jar /opt/flink/lib/
```

2. The you should add the following configurations to `conf/flink-conf.yaml` in the extracted Flink directory to configure Flink to use the remote shuffle service. Please note that the configuration of `remote-shuffle.ha.zookeeper.quorum` should be exactly the same as that in `kubernetes-shuffle-cluster-template.yaml`.

```yaml
shuffle-service-factory.class: com.alibaba.flink.shuffle.plugin.RemoteShuffleServiceFactory
remote-shuffle.high-availability.mode: ZOOKEEPER
remote-shuffle.ha.zookeeper.quorum: zk1.host:2181,zk2.host:2181,zk3.host:2181
```

3. Finally, you can start a Flink cluster on Kubernetes and submit a Flink job. Please refer to [start a Flink cluster on Kubernetes](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.14/docs/deployment/resource-providers/standalone/kubernetes/) or [Flink natively on Kubernetes](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.14/docs/deployment/resource-providers/native_kubernetes/) for more information.

## Logging & Configuration

From the above YAML file templates, you can figure out how to configure remote shuffle service on Kubernetes. 

Kubernetes operator related options and log output file are specified in `kubernetes-shuffle-operator-template.yaml`.

Any configurations in [configuration page](https://github.com/flink-extended/flink-remote-shuffle/blob/master/docs/configuration.md), log output format and log appender options of `ShuffleManager` and `ShuffleWorker` are configured in `kubernetes-shuffle-cluster-template.yaml`.
