/**
 * An implementation of the {@link HaServices} for the non-high-availability case. This
 * implementation can be used for testing, and for cluster setups that do not tolerate failures of
 * the master processes.

 * pre-configured ShuffleManager, and stores checkpoints and metadata simply on the heap or on a
 * local file system and therefore in a storage without guarantees.
 *
 * <p>This class is copied from Apache Flink
