 * these {@link #regionStarted}, {@link #onBuffer}, {@link #regionFinished} and {@link #finish}
 * method.
 *
 * <p>Data {@link Buffer} is the smallest piece of data can be written and data region is the basic
 * data unit can be written which can contain multiple data {@link Buffer}s. Data must be divided
 * into one or multiple data regions before writing. Each data region is a piece data that can be
 * consumed independently, which means a data region can not contain any partial records and data
 * compression should never span multiple data regions. As a result, we can rearrange the data
 * regions consumed by the same data consumer freely.
 *
 * <p>Before writing a data region, the {@link #regionStarted} method must be called, after which,
 * data {@link Buffer}s can be written through the {@link #onBuffer} method. Then the data region
 * can be marked as finished by the {@link #regionFinished} method. After all target data has been
 * written, the {@link #finish} method can be called to finish data writing.
